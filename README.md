# d3-crap
sorry i won't/can't explain what this is in detail and i am only keeping this here for personal reference. I can only say it is a histogram that is semi-dynamically sized on a linear scale with integer widths (no antialiasing artifacts, which as it turns out is non trivial to do without a d3.ordinalScale)

i will however show you it in action in this crappy heroku app as a placeholder:  https://warm-inlet-1988.herokuapp.com/#analytics
